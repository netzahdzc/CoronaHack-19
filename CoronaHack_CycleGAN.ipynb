Deeper networks are more likely to have vanishing or exploding gradients and, therefore, have trouble reaching convergence; batch normalization helps with this a bit. However, during training, we often see that deep networks respond with a kind of training degradation. Essentially, the training accuracy stops improving and gets saturated at some point during training. In the worst cases, deep models would see their training accuracy actually worsen over time!\n",

    "\n",
    "* The CycleGAN contains two mapping functions $G: X \\rightarrow Y$ and $F: Y \\rightarrow X$, and associated adversarial discriminators $D_Y$ and $D_X$. **(a)** $D_Y$ encourages $G$ to translate $X$ into outputs indistinguishable from domain $Y$, and vice versa for $D_X$ and $F$.\n",

    "## Least Squares GANs\n",
    "\n",
    "We've seen that regular GANs treat the discriminator as a classifier with the sigmoid cross entropy loss function. However, this loss function may lead to the vanishing gradients problem during the learning process. To overcome such a problem, we'll use a least squares loss function for the discriminator. This structure is also referred to as a least squares GAN or LSGAN, and you can [read the original paper on LSGANs, here](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1611.04076.pdf). The authors show that LSGANs are able to generate higher quality images than regular GANs and that this loss type is a bit more stable during training! \n",

    "### Discriminator Losses\n",
    "\n",
    "The discriminator losses will be mean squared errors between the output of the discriminator, given an image, and the target value, 0 or 1, depending on whether it should classify that image as fake or real. For example, for a *real* image, `x`, we can train $D_X$ by looking at how close it is to recognizing and image `x` as real using the mean squared error:\n",

    "Calculating the generator losses will look somewhat similar to calculating the discriminator loss; there will still be steps in which you generate fake images that look like they belong to the set of $X$ images but are based on real images in set $Y$, and vice versa. You'll compute the \"real loss\" on those generated images by looking at the output of the discriminator as it's applied to these _fake_ images; this time, your generator aims to make the discriminator classify these fake images as *real* images. \n",
    "\n",
    "#### Cycle Consistency Loss\n",

    "In addition to the adversarial losses, the generator loss terms will also include the **cycle consistency loss**. This loss is a measure of how good a reconstructed image is, when compared to an original image. \n",

    "Say you have a fake, generated image, `x_hat`, and a real image, `y`. You can get a reconstructed `y_hat` by applying `G_XtoY(x_hat) = y_hat` and then check to see if this reconstruction `y_hat` and the orginal image `y` match. For this, we recommed calculating the L1 loss, which is an absolute difference, between reconstructed and real images. You may also choose to multiply this loss by some weight value `lambda_weight` to convey its importance.\n",

    "A lot of experimentation goes into finding the best hyperparameters such that the generators and discriminators don't overpower each other. It's often a good starting point to look at existing papers to find what has worked in previous experiments, I'd recommend this [DCGAN paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1511.06434.pdf) in addition to the original [CycleGAN paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1703.10593.pdf) to see what worked for them. Then, you can try your own experiments based off of a good foundation.\n",

    "#### Discriminator Losses\n",
    "\n",
    "When you display the generator and discriminator losses you should see that there is always some discriminator loss; recall that we are trying to design a model that can generate good \"fake\" images. So, the ideal discriminator will not be able to tell the difference between real and fake images and, as such, will always have some loss. You should also see that $D_X$ and $D_Y$ are roughly at the same loss levels; if they are not, this indicates that your training is favoring one type of discriminator over the and you may need to look at biases in your models or data.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Generator Loss\n",
    "\n",
    "The generator's loss should start significantly higher than the discriminator losses because it is accounting for the loss of both generators *and* weighted reconstruction errors. You should see this loss decrease a lot at the start of training because initial, generated images are often far-off from being good fakes. After some time it may level off; this is normal since the generator and discriminator are both improving as they train. If you see that the loss is jumping around a lot, over time, you may want to try decreasing your learning rates or changing your cycle consistency loss to be a little more/less weighted.\n",
